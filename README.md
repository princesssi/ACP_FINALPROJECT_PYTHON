# RESTAURANT FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM

I. A brief project overview
- Restaurant Food Ordering System is a desktop-based application implemented in Python that will enable customers to be able to sign up, log into the system, and order food items easily. Graphical User Interface has been implemented using the Tkinter library to let the user see categories of menus, adding them into the cart for final payment of such orders. This application will encourage the user to donate toward the hunger relief programs in order to support the development on sustainability.

II. Explanation of how Python concepts, libraries, etc. were applied
- This project applies various concepts and libraries of Python in practice. Built using Object-Oriented Programming, OOP structures the code within classes for example, Orderable, FoodItem, Customer to make the code modular and reusable. Abstract classes ensure that each food category implements a specific method; for example, the calculation of price. The program handles any errors arising during the input validation process for phone numbers and quantities, ensuring everything is smooth in payment and smooth while providing a good user experience. GUI is designed with the Tkinter library. It has a friendly and intuitive interface. Also, the program covers regular expressions for the validation of phone numbers to check whether the number is 11 digits.

III. Details of the chosen SDG and its integration into the project
- This project supports Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. It aims to end hunger, improve nutrition, and promote food security. The system will have an optional feature for donations; customers can donate some money toward the hunger relief program. In this way, it brings awareness of the global hunger issue, but at the same time, it will also allow the customer to contribute to ending hunger while placing the order. By integrating this donation option, the project emphasizes social responsibility and encourages users to help address hunger in their communities and beyond.

IV. Instructions for running the Program
- The following application can be run using Python 3.x, with Tkinter for the interface. You will also need MySQL running to manage the database. Save your project file as restaurant_app.py. First, ensure that MySQL database credentials such as username and password are correctly set in the code. When everything is ready, launch a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the location where your restaurant_app.py file is saved. To launch the program, type python restaurant_app.py and press Enter.

- Users can register by providing their name, address, and phone number. Then they log in, browse the menu, and place their order. There is also an opportunity to donate to Zero Hunger. Finally, the system will provide a receipt containing information about the order and any donations made. This approach would not only improve customer service but also help to achieve the worldwide objective of Zero Hunger.
